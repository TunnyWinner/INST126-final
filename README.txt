# Data Fetcher Python Program

## Overview of the program

The Python program is designed to fetch and process data from an external API, employing advanced string manipulations and 
Git for version control. It serves as a foundation for data analysis and API interactions.

## Features of the program

1. **API Integration:**
   - Utilizes the `requests` library to interact with a specified API.
   - Sends HTTP requests, retrieves JSON data, and processes it for analysis.

2. **Advanced Strings:**
   - Demonstrates regular expressions for extracting specific information from API responses.
   - Showcases advanced string manipulation techniques.

3. **Git Version Control:**
   - Implements Git for version control to track changes and maintain a detailed history.
   - Users can create branches, commit changes, and collaborate on the codebase.

## How to use the program

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Ensure Python is installed on your machine.
   - Run `pip install requests` to install the required library.

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone the Git repository to your local machine using `git clone <https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com>`.

3. **Run the Program:**
   - Execute the Python script (`python data_fetcher.py`) to initiate data fetching.

4. **Explore the Codebase:**
   - Study the code to understand API interaction, data processing, and version control practices.

5. **Contribute and Version Control:**
   - Make changes, create branches, and commit updates using Git.
   - Push changes to the remote repository for collaboration.
